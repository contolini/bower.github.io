Over the past month, Bower has seen **88 commits**, **75 closed issues**, **34 wiki edits** and **2 releases** from **26 contributors** spread across **15 timezones**. Amazing.

But here's the *really* impressive part: Nearly all those contributors had never touched Bower's codebase until just a few weeks ago when Adam and Dave [asked for help](http://bower.io/blog/2015/bower-alive-looking-contributors/). Developers eagerly responded and immediately began triaging issues, writing documentation and fixing bugs. Not only is Bower now more stable and feature-rich, but it now has a community supporting it.

As with many open source projects, we're fortunate to be standing on the shoulders of giants. Bower was handcrafted by some [incredibly talented developers](https://github.com/bower/bower/graphs/contributors). As the project moves forward, it's exciting to know the number of contributors will continue to grow.

Today we're releasing [v1.7.0](https://github.com/bower/bower/releases/tag/v1.7.0) which includes fixes and enhancements that have been on Bower's radar for years.

Then check out the [contributing guide](https://github.com/bower/bower/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and join us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/bower/bower). Two great ways to introduce yourself to the codebase is to review a [pull request](https://github.com/bower/bower/pulls) or write [some tests](https://github.com/bower/bower/tree/master/test). Our [code coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/bower/bower) isn't perfect but it can improve with your help. Want to support Bower but don't have a lot of time?
